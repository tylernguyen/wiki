# X1C6 Hackintosh

## FAQ

### Does everything work?

Core functions work flawlessly. Notable non-functional features include the fingerprint reader, WWAN, and USB 3.1 Gen2 hotplug.

### Is this project maintained?

Yes, until eventually my x1c6 dies or macOS phases out update (even then, it'll likely last a few more years).

### Can this brick my laptop?

Not very likely, expect drive wipes and lost time, however.

### Can you port this for X machine?

No.

### How do I keep my Hackintosh setup updated?

Currently, there is no automatic solution available. For now, I recommend you create a GitHub watch alert and update the EFI as it comes along.
