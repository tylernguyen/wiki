# Blog :lucide-construction:{ .solarized-yellow }

/// warning | TRANSITION IN PROGRESS!
Previously, `.wiki` used :simple-materialformkdocs:{ .materialformkdocs } [Material for MkDocs (Insiders) :octicons-arrow-up-right-16:](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). However, the project is now in __maintenance mode__.

I have since transitioned the majority of `.wiki` to ![Zensical](https://assets.tylernguyen.wiki/logos/Zensical.png){ .twemoji } [Zensical :octicons-arrow-up-right-16:](https://github.com/zensical/zensical), the successor project built by the same author.

However, Zensical still lacks proper supporting for blogging. Until that is released, `.wiki` will not have a blog.

Until then, __feel free to explore other parts of `.wiki`!__
