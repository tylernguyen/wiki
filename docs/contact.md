/// success | What I'll DEFINITELY respond to.

- Meaningful replies, critiques, and/or thoughts on things I have written/published are always welcomed. I take criticism fairly well and will do my best to express my thoughts in responding.

- Genuine topic suggestions, that is: a recommendation with purpose, reasons, and some background information.

- Ex: "Please look into X, I've found to be very useful in dealing with Y situation and is a better solution than Z." or "Please write about X topic, I read your previous Y page and the two seems connected. So it would be great to see a new perspective on the two together."
///

/// note | What I MAY or MAY NOT respond to.

- I try and respond to technical queries but would prefer and suggest you try Google first.

- If your message doesn't explicitly look like it needs a response: being vague or unclear what the purpose is, you may not hear back from me.

/// failure | What I'll definitely NOT respond to

- [Don't ask to ask, just ask.](https://dontasktoask.com/)

- [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)

- No guest posts, linking, cross-promotions, and/or solicitations will be accepted.

- Do not bump my email inbox by sending another email without substance. By doing so, you are annoying me and lessening a chance that I will reply.
