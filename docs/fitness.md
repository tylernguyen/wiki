# Fitness

I'm by no means a fitness freak. But I do exercise regularly and keep track of what I eat.

## Hardware

- __Apple Watch Ultra 1st Gen__

I'm very satisfied with the Apple Watch Ultra 1st Gen. It's a great balance between iPhone companion and fitness tracker. Importantly, the battery life of the Ultra means that I don't have to pay too much mind to charging. I don't forsee an upgrade anytime soon.

## Apple HealthKit ![Appple HealthKit](https://assets.tylernguyen.wiki/logos/Apple_HealthKit.png){ .twemoji }

I do trust the security and privacy of Apple Health. Ideally, there would be a self-hosted solution that integrates well with other apps. But for now, HealthKit is likely the best option.
