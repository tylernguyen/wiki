# Fitness

I do try to exercise regularly and keep track of what I eat. Swimming is my favorite activity but I run much more often. I'm not at all a lifter but occasionally, I do dabble with light weights.

## Gear

- __Apple Watch Ultra 1st Gen__

I'm very satisfied with the Apple Watch Ultra 1st Gen. It's a great balance between iPhone companion and fitness tracker. Importantly, the battery life of the Ultra means that I don't have to pay too much mind to charging. I don't foresee an upgrade anytime soon.

- __Shokz OpenSwim__

### Shoes

- ASICS Novablast 3

## Software

I use __Intervals.icu__ for planning and analysis. It's free, powerful, and highly customizable. The developer, [David :octicons-arrow-up-right-16:](https://forum.intervals.icu/u/david/summary), is accessible and responsive. It's web-only, so I use __HealthFit__ as the ![Apple HealthKit](https://assets.tylernguyen.wiki/logos/Apple_HealthKit.png){ .twemoji } Apple HealthKit bridge.

__Gentler Streak__ is especially nice as a simpler companion to more data-heavy fitness tracker. I recommend you use the app and wait until you are targeted for a discounted lifetime offer.
